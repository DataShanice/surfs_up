## Anlysis 
  During my analysis of temperatures between June and December, I noticed many differences that could have change the way the data that was recieved. My recommendations are based off of the dataframes that we're created to show the following: Count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75% and max Temperatures. What I did observed was the data was based off of each day in June and December. We could have added the temperatures from all the summer months as well as the winter months instead to give a more well rounded view on the the climate during each season. It woulld certainly help with predictive analysis for those looking to travel for holiday events or those who choose to relocate during a specific season. 
  I would also recommend a seperate analysis that included the months of June and Decemebr in a five year span. That would show a shift in climate (if any) in the specific area, which also help in a predicitive analysis for future study of climate change.
